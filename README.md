# ModularFuelTankExpansion
A collection of 52 modular parts designed to allow for greater flexibility in craft configuration.

The current masses of the tanks is set to a mostly-stock standard ratio of 
1/8 the mass of the fuel.

There is an optional patch in the Extras directory, which uses a more precise
calculation based on the tank size.  The numbers in the patch are slightly
higher, but more realistic.

This supports ConnectedLivingSpace, ModularFuelTanks, and TweakScale.
IFS specific patches have been removed since the stock IFS patches
work well with the mod
